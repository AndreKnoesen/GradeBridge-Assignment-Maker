## The Problem

**Traditional workflow:** 3+ hours fighting with Word formatting, equation editors, and inconsistent student submissions.

**GradeBridge workflow:** 15 minutes to create professional assignments that auto-generate perfectly formatted student PDFs.

**The two-app workflow:**
1. **Assignment Maker** (this app) - Instructors create structured assignments
2. **[Student Submission](https://github.com/VeriQAi/GradeBridge-Student-Submission)** - Students complete work and generate grading-ready PDFs

---

## Key Features

- **100% Browser-Based** - No server, no account, no data transmission. Everything stays on your computer.
- **Structured Assignments** - Problems with subsections, points, and multiple submission types
- **LaTeX Math Support** - Live preview with built-in cheatsheet (fractions, integrals, Greek letters, matrices)
- **Multiple Submission Types** - Text, image uploads, and AI reflective documentation
- **Export Options** - JSON (for students), PDF (for Gradescope), or complete ZIP package
- **Load Example** - One-click sample assignment to explore features instantly

## Assignment JSON Format

Exported assignments use this structure (compatible with Student Submission app):

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "courseCode": "ECE416",
  "title": "Mini-Project 1",
  "dueDate": "2024-12-01",
  "dueTime": "23:59",
  "preamble": "Complete all problems showing your work...",
  "problems": [
    {
      "id": "prob-1",
      "name": "State-Space Analysis",
      "description": "Analyze the following system using state-space methods.",
      "subsections": [
        {
          "id": "prob-1-a",
          "name": "Derive Representation",
          "description": "Derive the state-space representation",
          "points": 10,
          "submissionType": "Text",
          "maxImages": 0
        },
        {
          "id": "prob-1-b",
          "name": "Step Response",
          "description": "Plot the step response",
          "points": 10,
          "submissionType": "Image",
          "maxImages": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": 1700000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1700000000000
}
```

**Submission Types:** `Text`, `Image`, `AI Reflective`

## Data & Privacy

- All data stored in browser localStorage
- No server communication, no analytics, no account required
- Data persists across browser restarts
- **Always export JSON backups** - data is lost if you clear browser cache

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Assignment won't load | Verify JSON was exported from Assignment Maker |
| LaTeX not rendering | Refresh page; KaTeX loads from CDN |
| PDF generation slow | Reduce image count/size; large PDFs take 10-20s |
| Lost work | Always export JSON backups regularly |
