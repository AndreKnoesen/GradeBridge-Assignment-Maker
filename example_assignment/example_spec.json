Your log does not need to be exhaustive, but should provide a reasonable overview of your interaction with the AI: you should include the important questions you asked but can omit the complete text of the AI's response and minor follow up questions. An example is provided on Canvas. Provide 1-3 sentences in answer to the following questions:",
