## Contributing Code

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- A modern code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic understanding of React and TypeScript

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GradeBridge-Assignment-Maker.git
   cd GradeBridge-Assignment-Maker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

4. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed

5. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run dev      # Test in development mode
   npm run build    # Ensure it builds
   npm run preview  # Test the production build
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

   Use clear, concise commit messages:
   - `Add feature: Problem duplication`
   - `Fix: PDF generation with LaTeX equations`
   - `Update: README with new export options`

7. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then open a PR on GitHub using our [PR template](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

### Development Workflow

- **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR
- **Update from main regularly**: Rebase or merge to stay current
- **Test thoroughly**: Especially JSON export and PDF generation
- **Document changes**: Update README or add inline comments
- **Be responsive**: Address review feedback promptly

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/React

- Use **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- Write **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React best practices**:
  - Use descriptive component and variable names
  - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
  - Keep components small and focused
  - Avoid prop drilling (use context when appropriate)

### Code Formatting

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **single quotes** for strings
- Add **trailing commas** in multi-line arrays/objects
- Use **const** by default, **let** only when reassignment is needed
- Avoid **any** types - use proper TypeScript types

Example:
```typescript
// Good
const [assignmentTitle, setAssignmentTitle] = useState<string>('');

interface AssignmentProps {
  assignment: Assignment;
  onExport: (format: ExportFormat) => void;
}

export const AssignmentEditor: React.FC<AssignmentProps> = ({ assignment, onExport }) => {
  // Component logic
};

// Avoid
var title = '';  // Use const/let
const handleExport = (data: any) => {};  // Use proper types
```

### File Organization

- **Components**: One component per file
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Location**: Place files in appropriate directories (components/, services/, types/)

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Add comments for:
  - Complex algorithms or business logic
  - PDF generation logic
  - Gradescope-specific requirements
  - JSON format specifications
  - Educational context

```typescript
// Good: Explains why, not what
// Each subsection needs its own page to match Gradescope template regions
// This ensures auto-grading can map student answers to correct problems
const pagesNeeded = assignment.subsections.length;
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, test:

1. **Core Workflows**
   - Create a new assignment
   - Add problems with subsections
   - Upload problem images
   - Use LaTeX in problem statements
   - Export to JSON
   - Export to PDF
   - Export to ZIP
   - Load existing assignment JSON

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Large assignments (20+ problems)
   - Complex LaTeX expressions
   - Large problem images
   - All submission type combinations

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Export JSON and test in Student Submission app
   - Generate PDF and upload to Gradescope
   - Verify page structure matches expectations

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on both desktop and tablet if possible

### Automated Testing

While we don't currently have a comprehensive test suite, contributions of tests are welcome:

- Unit tests for export services
- Integration tests for PDF generation
- Tests for JSON format validation

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions and components
- Document complex types and interfaces
- Include examples for non-obvious usage

```typescript
/**
 * Generates a PDF template for Gradescope with proper page breaks
 * @param assignment - The complete assignment structure
 * @param options - PDF generation options (margins, format, etc.)
 * @returns Promise resolving to Blob containing the PDF
 */
export const generatePDF = async (
  assignment: Assignment,
  options: PDFOptions
): Promise<Blob> => {
  // ...
};
```

### User Documentation

If your change affects how educators use the app:

- Update the README.md
- Add examples or screenshots
- Document new JSON format fields
- Mention it in your PR description

## JSON Format Compatibility

### Critical: Maintain Backward Compatibility

Changes to the JSON export format must:

- **Be backward compatible** with existing assignments
- **Work with Student Submission app** (coordinate changes)
- **Document new fields** clearly
- **Include migration notes** if breaking changes are unavoidable

### Testing JSON Changes

If your PR modifies the JSON format:

1. Export a sample assignment
2. Test loading it in the Student Submission app
3. Verify all fields are correctly interpreted
4. Test PDF generation from both apps
5. Document the changes in your PR

## Privacy and Educational Context

### Privacy Requirements

All contributions **must maintain**:

- **Client-side processing**: No data sent to servers
- **LocalStorage only**: No cookies, tracking, or analytics
- **Export control**: Educators can backup and manage their data
- **No external dependencies** that compromise privacy

### Educational Considerations

Remember that this tool is used to create academic assessments:

- **Academic integrity**: Support fair assessment practices
- **Accessibility**: Consider students with disabilities in PDF output
- **Clarity**: Assignments should be clear and unambiguous
- **Flexibility**: Support diverse question types and disciplines
- **Gradescope compatibility**: Maintain PDF structure requirements

## Response Times
